Bud_id = 104545
Summary = Make default size of empty composites smaller 
Description = Could the following two constants in Widget.java be changed to something smaller? 
/* Default widths for widgets */ static final int DEFAULT_WIDTH = 64; static final int DEFAULT_HEIGHT = 64; 
Anything less than or equal to 16 would work for us, 0 would be OK too. 
I have run our tests (JFace, UI, RCP) and they run fine when the constants are 0. 
Background: When you write an RCP app and enable the cool bar, the cool bar will initially be empty, 
but 64x64 pixels in size. 
On Windows, you cannot see the border of the empty coolbar so the user gets a big empty space at the top of their window 
and might be confused. 
Changed classes = CoolBar.java


Bud_id = 95410
Summary = GDI+ drawString is not consistent with GDI
Description = If you have a structure which is rendered to a GC, you need to be able to predict things like how large a String is going to be painted. 
But, if a previous visitor has triggered GDI+, drawString's behavior is altered. 
The chars get expanded and compressed in funny ways, and generally look bad. 
";"Defect";"
Changed classes = GC.java, TextLayout.java, Gdip.java, OS.java


Bud_id = 92341
Summary = DCR - Add SWT.VIRTUAL style to Tree widget 
Description = Please add a possibility to lazy-load the first tree level (like SWT.VIRTUAL for the table widget). 
Changed classes = Tree.java, TreeColumn.java, TreeItem.java"
