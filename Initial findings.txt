[DONE] 1- Delete below line in Dockerfile
RUN cd /concodese/bin && ./UpdateProjectConfigData.sh

[DONE] 2- Replace following line in Dockerfile so the path to properties file in the config directory is also recognised 
ENTRYPOINT [ "sh", "-c", "/usr/bin/java -cp /concodese/config:/concodese/config/lic:/concodese/bin/ConCodeSe-1.0.0.jar com.concodese.ConCodeSeJettyServerStarter SERVER_PORT=8081  >> /concodese/log/console_concodese.log"]

3- file names should be with package id from the content of the file
e.g. file SearchAndRank.java in /User/tezcan/projects/concodese/src/java/com/concodese/repository/services/ 
should have file id in the map as com.concodese.repository.services.SearchAndRank.java

4- some identifiers are not being tokenized fully
e.g. in org.eclipse.swt.events.TypedEvents.java following identifiers are not tokenized
token ---> expected
-----------------------------------
"getClass" ---> "get", "class"
"TypedEvent" ---> "typed", "event",
"getName" ---> "get", "name",
"Widget" ---> "widget",
"String" ---> "string",
"serialVersionUID" ---> "serial", "version", "uid",
"SWTEventObject ---> "swt", "event", "object"
At the end the json for the above file should be as below
  "org.eclipse.swt.events.TypedEvent.java" : {
    "widget" : "widget",
    "data" : "data",
    "string" : "string",
    "e" : "e",
    "display" : "displai",
    "index" : "index",
    "version" : "version",
    "typed" : "type",
    "uid" : "uid",
    "serial" : "serial",
    "time" : "time",
    "event" : "event",
    "object" : "object"
  },
  
5- make all tokens in the map lower case
 
[DONE] 6- make local location of the source files parent directory as argument to run.sh
e.g. the left hand side of this /Users/tezcan/projects:/projects can be provided as an argument when executing the run.sh script
something like $(arg1):/projects where $(arg1) comes from "./run.sh /Users/tezcan/projects"
  
7- fast.jar needs to be available form maven central repository for build

[DONE] 8- Make docker image of Jira ignore any local (host) installations of Jira. Act as though there is no Jira installed

9- Prepare a docker image only with ConCodeSe and Fast (without Jira). This image assumes that Jira is already installed on a server.
